# SpikeReport

SpikeReport is a software that is currently under development, which has the goal to allow drink spiking victims to speak out anonymously. Using anonymously gathered anecdotal evidence, SpikeReport tries to collect as much data as possible to determine the extent of this problem.


## Development stage of SpikeReport

The development on SpikeReport has just started. As SpikeReport aims to allow global anonymous reporting of drink spiking incidents, considerations towards translations and modular applications have to be made.

## The idea behind SpikeReport

While SpikeReport mainly is gathering data on drink spiking incidents, which rarely are reported to law enforcement unless serious harm is done, SpikeReport also aims to visualize that data in the future for researchers and law enforcement alike.
This includes making a map which shows the areas in which most drink spiking incidents are reported, in which frequency, and so on.

SpikeReport aims to be a global contact point for drink spiking victims, allowing them to speak out anonymously without fear of repercussion or victim blaming.
